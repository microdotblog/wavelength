Wavelength is the Micro.blog companion iOS app for short podcasts, or microcasts. It is free to use but requires a Micro.blog Premium account to upload podcasts.

About the open source project... We welcome feedback and bug fixes. The app already does what we want it to do, so if you want to add significant new functionality, we may not end up integrating that into the version of the app in the App Store. If you use the code in another project, please don't use the name Wavelength.

You may notice references to Lumos in the source code. That was an early code name for the project.
