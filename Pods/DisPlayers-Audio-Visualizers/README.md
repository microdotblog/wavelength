# DisPlayers-Audio-Visualizers
DisPlayer is a customizable audio visualization component that works with recording and playing back audio files

The audio visualizer can be easily embedded into an app that features:
* audio comments to text or multimedia posts
* recording and sending audio files in a chat
* playing back audio files posted in a chat using a dedicated UI component

DisPlayer features 5 default visualization presets that can be customized by the background color (single tone or gradient), the wave color, the number of the wave’s bins/bars, and the wave amplitude.

## Installation
